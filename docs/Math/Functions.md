### Definition

Function is a relation between two Set A and B such that for every element in Set A there is an image in Set B.
Such relationship is denoted as follows  $f: A \rightarrow B$.


### Understanding intuitively

Another way to think of function is as a black box. This particular box has two holes on two opposite sides. It takes one or more input through one hole, does some operations with those inputs and returns you the output of the final operation through the other hole. For better understanding we can take the following example:

$$
f(x) = x + 1
$$

This function $f(x)$ takes an input x then adds 1 to $x$ and returns/outputs whatever the value($x + 1$) turns out to be.

- input : x
- operation : x + 1
- output : result of x + 1

For example if we pass in 4 as input we get 5 as output.

$$
f(4) = 4 + 1 = 5
$$

An important thing to know about functions is, for the same input a function will always result in the same output. Meaning, for the above function $f(x)$ it does not matter how many times we pass in 4 as input , it will always return 5. This is also known as a **pure function**. 


### Visualizing via Sets

We can express functions through Sets by constructing one Set consisting a number inputs (Set A) and another consisting the following corresponding outputs for those inputs (Set B). For the following example function,

$$
f(x) = x + 1
$$

such two set can be as follows:
$$
Set A = \{{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}}
$$
$$
Set B = \{{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}}
$$

Here, $Set(A)$ and $Set(B)$ are also known as  $Domain$  and  $Co-domain$  respectively.
