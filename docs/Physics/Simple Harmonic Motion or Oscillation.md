# Definitions

## Simple Harmonic Motion

A **Simple Harmonic Motion**, or **SHM**, is defined as a motion in which the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement of the body from its mean position or equilibrium. The direction of this restoring force is always towards the mean position. The acceleration of a particle executing simple harmonic motion is given by a(t) = -ω<sup>2</sup> x(t). Here, ω is the angular velocity of the particle.

## Restoring Force

Forces that work towards bringing a displaced body / system back to its equilibrium state are known as **restoring forces**.

## Amplitude

The magnitude of the maximum displacement from equilibrium ($x_m$ this case) is called the **amplitude** of the motion.

## Period

The time necessary for one complete cycle (as shown in the above image) is called the period($T$). Period is measured in "time" units (normally in seconds).

## Frequency

number of cycles per unit time is called the frequency $f$. The frequency and the period are reciprocals of one another:
$$
f = \dfrac{1}{T}
$$
 Frequency is measured in the SI units (Hz), where 1 Hz = 1 cycle/s. Thus, for example, an oscillation with a period of T  5 s has a frequency f  0.2 Hz.

## Turning Points

The points at which the oscillating body comes to a stop ($v_x = 0$) and starts moving in the opposite direction towards the equilibrium are called the **turning points** of the motion.


# Conditions for Oscillation

-  The force must always act to restore the particle to equilibrium.
-  The potential energy must have a minimum at the equilibrium position.
