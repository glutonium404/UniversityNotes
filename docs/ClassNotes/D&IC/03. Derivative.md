## Definition
For a given function $y = f(x)$ , where $y$ is a function of $x$ , the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ is denoted by $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ or $y\prime$ or $y_1$ and is defined by ,

$$
\dfrac{dy}{dx} = f\prime (x) = D_x = \quad \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \dfrac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} 
$$

$$
\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \quad \lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} 
$$

Otherwise known as the **first principle of differentiation**.
