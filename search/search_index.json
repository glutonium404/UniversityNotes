In real life, things don't move at a constant velocity or at a constant acceleration. Rather they change over time and at some point the velocity may be more and at some point it may be less. For that same case you can not use formulas like the following as a lot us have done in our school and college day in physics when measuring the velocity or acceleration.</p> \\[ \\begin{align*} &amp; v = \\dfrac{x}{t} \\\\[8pt] \\text{Where,} \\\\[8pt] &amp; v = velocity \\\\ &amp; x = displacement \\\\ &amp; t = time \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] <p>That's cause here we are just assuming that in per unit of time , the vehicle is always moving a constant amount.

When we are given a graph that shows the relation between , say for example velocity vs time, we can use differentiation to measure the rate at which the velocity is changing at any point in time.</p> <p>For example, let's say the graph looks something like this, where you have the displacement(\\(x\\)) along the \\(y\\) axis and time\\((t)\\) along the \\(x\\) axis.</p> <p></p> <p>If we are asked, what is the velocity when time was \\(5\\) ?
